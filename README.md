## About CodeCamp 2023
CodeCamp 2023 is a student-run community service project led by the Computing Club of School of Computing (SoC), National University of Singapore (NUS).
This annual initiative is planned by the Community Service Cell of the Computing Club under the Children Service Project.
It is targeted at youths from underserved communities who have an interest in coding, and serves as a platform for SoC students to give back to the community and share useful knowledge which they have gained during their course of study at NUS.
